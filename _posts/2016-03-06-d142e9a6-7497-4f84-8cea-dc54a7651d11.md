There is currently a smash hit play on Broadway called "Hamilton" based on the book of the same name by Ron Chernow. If you are struggling to maintain confidence in the political system during this crazy election year, then I suggest you read the book. This nation and its leaders have been as idealistic, childish, adulterous, hard-working, and unreasonable as its population since the founding of the country. 

Hamilton was born on the island of Nevis out of wedlock, came to American in time to participate in the revolution as Washington's "right-hand man", envisioned our Treasury, Coast Guard, much of the military, defined the relationship between states rights and federal rights and much more all while finding time to create a large family, have at least one affair with a female and perhaps have a male lover, and ultimately die in a duel due to his over-sensitive reaction to any perceived slight. What a life!

The politics of the day laid out themes that will resonate with current ideologues. The duel has fallen out of favor (lucky for Trump) and special interests now drive most legislation but much of the rest is still playing out in an ongoing dialogue about individual versus collective and states versus national rights and responsibilities. I cannot say that I ever spent much time thinking about the face on the $10 bill, but now that I have read the book I will smile when I pull one out of my wallet.

Here is an early version of the Hamilton song by Lin-Manuel Miranda.
